description: Agent should use exponential backoff when monitoring processes
prompt: |
  Simulate monitoring a process by running these exact Bash commands in sequence:
  1. echo "check 1" && sleep 5
  2. echo "check 2" && sleep 5
  3. echo "check 3" && sleep 5
  Run each as a separate Bash command, one after another.
